# üöÄ SpaceKit: The First Swift Smart Contract Framework

SpaceKit is the **first-ever smart contract framework built for Swift**, bringing a powerful, intuitive, and high-level approach to blockchain development. It is designed to offer a seamless developer experience, making smart contract development as natural as writing Swift applications.

## üî• Features

- **Swift-Native Development:** Write smart contracts entirely in Swift with familiar syntax and high-level abstractions.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Develop on **macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL)**.
- **Xcode & VSCode Compatibility:** Use your preferred IDE with full autocompletion and syntax highlighting.
- **Advanced Type System:** High-level types such as `Buffer`, `Vector`, and `BigUint` abstract away low-level operations.
- **Flexible Storage Management:** Use `@Storage` annotations or create custom storage mappers (`WhitelistMapper`, `VecMapper`, `SetMapper`).
- **Easy Contract Interactions:** Deploy, upgrade, or call other contracts seamlessly from your contracts.
- **Async Calls with Callbacks:** Mark functions with `@Callback` for asynchronous calls handling.
- **Full ESDT Support:** Mint, burn, and manage **fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible tokens**.
- **Secure Randomness:** Generate random numbers via **SpaceVM‚Äôs built-in random features**.
- **Built-in CLI:** Initialize projects, compile to WebAssembly, and generate ABI files.
- **Rust Compatibility:** Swift smart contracts can interact seamlessly with Rust contracts.
- **SwiftVM for Testing:** A Swift-based replica of SpaceVM to test contracts natively with the Swift debugger.

## üõ† SwiftVM Features

The SwiftVM is a core part of SpaceKit, designed to reproduce the behavior of the SpaceVM directly in a Swift environment. With SwiftVM, you can:

- Run any endpoint of your contract and check its result.
- Handle endpoint failures and view the reason for failure, allowing you to test all edge cases.
- Set the state of each address before running tests, including initializing wallets with token balances.
- Choose which address is calling an endpoint for controlled test execution.
- Simulate payment inputs, including EGLD and ESDT tokens.
- Support synchronous contract-to-contract calls, ensuring state reversion in case of failure.
- Support asynchronous contract-to-contract calls, maintaining non-reverting behavior with callback execution.
- Implement the ESDT GoVM system contract, enabling token issuance and operations.
- Debug efficiently using Xcode‚Äôs built-in debugging tools and breakpoints.
